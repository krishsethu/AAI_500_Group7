# AAI_500_Group7 (Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modeling for AIDS Virus Infection)
This project is a part of the AAI_500_Group7 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD) with the objective of developing an end-to-end statistical analysis of a dataset.

Project Status: [Planned, Active, On-hold, Completed]

 Title of the Project: Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modeling for AIDS Virus Infection

 Short Description of the Project: This project performs a Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modeling for AIDS Virus Infection

 Objectives of the Project: 
1) To develop a predictive model for AIDS virus Infection using the clinical data.
2) We aim to identify the key risk factors associated with the HIV infection and asses their impact
   through probability and statistical analysis. 
3) We aim to perform Descriptive statistics like calculation of mean, median, mode, variance and 
   standard deviation for numerical variables to gain insights into the central tendency and dispersion 
   of numerical variables such as age and clinical data to understand the characteristics of the population. 
4) We aim to perform Inferential statistics like Hypothesis testing and chi-squared tests
   to compare means between different groups (for example: infected vs non-infected patients)
   and derive conclusions about the broader population based on the sample data
5) We aim to perform Predictive modeling to establish the relationship between predictors 
   like (clinical results) and the viral infection using logistic regression analysis, and correlation analysis.
   This would predict the likelihood of HIV infection based on various predictors
