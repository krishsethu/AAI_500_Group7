 Ttle of the Project: Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modeling for AIDS Virus Infection

 Short Description of the Project: This project performs a Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modeling for AIDS Virus Infection

 Objectives of the Project: 
1) To develop a predictive model for AIDS virus Infection using the clinical data.
2) We aim to identify the key risk factors associated with the HIV infection and asses their impact
   through probability and statistical analysis. 
3) We aim to perform Descriptive statistics like calculation of mean, median, mode, variance and 
   standard deviation for numerical variables to gain insights into the central tendency and dispersion 
   of numerical variables such as age and on clinical data to understand characteristics of population. 
4) We aim to perform Inferential statistics like perform Hypothesis testing and chi-squared tests
   to compare means between different groups (for example: infected vs non-infected patients)
   and derive conclusions about the broader population based on the sample data
5) We aim to perform Predictive modeling to establish the relationship between predictors 
   like (clinical results) and the viral infection using logistic regression analysis, correlation analysis.
   This would predict the likelihood of HIV infection based on various predictors
