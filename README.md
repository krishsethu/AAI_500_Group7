# AAI_500_Group7 (Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modeling for AIDS Virus Infection)
This project is a part of the AAI_500_Group7 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD) with the objective of developing an end-to-end statistical analysis of a dataset.

Project Status: [Completed]

 Title of the Project: Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modeling for AIDS Virus Infection

 Short Description of the Project: This project performs a Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modeling for AIDS Virus Infection

 Objectives of the Project: 
1) To develop a predictive model for AIDS virus Infection using the clinical data.
2) We aim to identify the key risk factors associated with the HIV infection and assess their impact trough probability and statistical analysis.
3) We aim to perform statistical analysis to gain insights into the central tendency and dispersion of numerical variables such as age, gender and on clinical data to understand characteristics of population.
4) We aim to compute Inferential statistics in different groups (for example: infected vs non-infected patients) and derive conclusions about the broader population based on the sample data
5) We aim to perform predictive modeling to establish the relationship between explanatory variables and response variables using classification algorithm.
